The Boden Lab is a bioinformatics research group in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, at The University of Queensland, Australia.

Biology is quickly becoming the biggest producer of data in the 21st century, overtaking YouTube, Twitter, and astronomy ([Stephens et al, *PLoS Biology* 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195)). While acquisition, storage, and distribution are monumental hurdles, our group aims to address the challenge of extracting information from biological data, using computational and analytical strategies.

We believe that this big data generation is going to spur on the next great revolution in science, bringing biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. Physics underwent a similar revolution through the 1900s, as great theoretical physicists like Einstein, Bohr, and Feynman used mathematics to model physical phenomena to greatly improve our understanding of the world around us. A similar revolution is currently underway in biology as we build computational models to help cure cancer, understand organism development, and even engineer proteins for industrial purposes. 

Our mission is to develop methodologies of theoretical biology and bioinformatics that help scientiest understand fundamental processes in molecular and cellular biology. But biology is complicated. We need to meet challenges of scale to create useful models on which to base predictions. On the flip side, greater scale gives statistical power to distinguish biologically meaningful signals from mere noise or artefacts, i.e. to identify "drivers" and "determinants" of function and structure. Sometimes the number of features (that describe each observation) is so great that we must rely on and integrate (biological) expertise to constrain the search for signals.

We use cutting edge probabilistic graphical models and machine learning techniques that utilises this big data in order to make biological predictions that inform protein engineering, tissue engineering, developmental biology, and disease research. 

Our research aims to

1. effectively manage the complexity of operations involved in analysing millions of sequence reads, thousands of genomes, and proteomes of thousands of dynamically regulated molecules, etc
2. enable the seamless aggregation (or integration) of uncertain and incomplete data, typical of the next wave of biotechnology, across genomics, proteomics, structural biology, etc, and of using biological expertise 
3. empower the interpretation of "whole system" data, aimed at understanding of basis of disease and other scientifically relevant phenotypes, using statistics and machine learning
