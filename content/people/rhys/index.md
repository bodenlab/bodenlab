Rhys has been working on assessing the reproducibility of genome wide binding assays like ChIP-seq and ChIA-PET when multiple replicates are present. He completed his honours thesis in semester 1 of 2018, at the university of Queensland under the supervision of Alex Essebier and Mikael Boden.

Rhys' honours project involved the development of a tool capable of assessing the reproducibility of ChIP-seq peaks using the rank product statistical method. The tool is publicly available for use at â€¦

Rhys plans to begin a PhD project during the second half of 2018.
