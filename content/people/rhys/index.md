Rhys Newell is currently a PhD Candidate partially supervised by Benjamin Woodcroft, Gene Tyson, and Mikael Boden. Rhys 
completed his Honours degree in bioinformatics within the Boden Lab where he developed a tool to assess and refine reproducible
peak regions using multiple ChIP-seq replicates called [ChIP-R](https://github.com/rhysnewell/ChIP-R).

Currently, Rhys' main work focuses on the development of novel methods to achieve strain-level metagenome-assembled genomes
from metagenomic datasets in the form of a tool called [Lorikeet](https://rhysnewell.github.io/Lorikeet).

Additionally, Rhys works on developing methods to quantify metabolite abundances from FTICR-MS data and correct sampling error
between machine runs.
