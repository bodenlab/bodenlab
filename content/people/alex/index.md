Alex completed her undergraduate degrees in Science (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) and Information Technology at the University of Queensland in 2013 then her Master of Bioinformatics in 2015. Alex first developed an interest in bioinformatics in her second year of university when she discovered it would allow her to solve a variety of biological problems through the application of her programming skills. She has undertaken a number of research projects over the last four years as part of Mikael Bodén’s group at UQ. These projects involved large biological datasets and allowed Alex to explore big data techniques to extract relevant patterns and relationships. Her main focus is on the use of machine learning to analyse high-throughput genomic datasets. 

She is currently enrolled as a PhD student investigating the application of machine learning to predict long distance regulatory interactions. The ability to accurately detect these interactions can improve our understanding of developmental disorders and diseases such as cancer. Alex’s multidisciplinary background has allowed her to provide bioinformatic insight on a number of research projects engaging with multiple collaborators. It has also provided her with the skills to drive her own research and work toward developing new bioinformatic tools and techniques.
