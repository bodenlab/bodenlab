My PhD is from the University of Exeter, UK, in computer science, AI and machine learning. I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at The University of Queensland. I was a senior research fellow in the Institute for Molecular Bioscience before my current appointment as Associate Professor at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, both at UQ. I am the Director of Bioinformatics postgraduate programs.

My research has been awarded funding from various grant agencies, including the Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council ([see here ](http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/research/) for some official info). With biological data available at phenomenal scales, my group and I use data driven, probabilistic and algorithmic approaches to solve problems in genomics, systems and protein biology. Sequence analysis, regulatory genomics and phylogenetics are major themes in my group. We are also developing tools for exploring the evolution of proteins, with applications in protein engineering. We work closely with collaborators across the disciplines, including genomics, genetics, stem and developmental biology, biochemistry and structural biology.

We publish our work in key journals such as *Bioinformatics* and *Nucleic Acids Research*; check out citations to [my papers on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c94OdU0AAAAJ) or download the papers by looking them up [here](/publications).
