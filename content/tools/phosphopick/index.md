PhosphoPICK is a method for predicting kinase substrates using an integrated system of cellular context and protein sequence information, and is currently able to make predictions for 107 human kinases, 24 mouse kinases and 26 yeast kinases. If this is your first time using PhosphoPICK, the tutorial section contains more information on how the algorithm works, and how to interpret the results.
